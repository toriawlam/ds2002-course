# General Setup

## Git & GitHub (Required)

Everyone will need a GitHub account. If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip step 1. 

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com</a> and click **Sign up**
2. Follow the prompts to create your account
3. Verify your email address if required

### Step 2: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the original repository on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/ksiller/ds2002-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ksiller/ds2002-course</a>
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
3. Select your account as the destination for the fork, e.g. if your GitHub account is "msmith", you'd use `msmith/ds2002-course` as the name for the forked repo (should be set as default).
4. Wait for the fork to complete
5. **Bookmark the webpage of your forked GitHub repository. You will be using it frequently :)** 

### Step 3: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

**Note:** This step is required if you plan to use git on your own computer/laptop.

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are an established best practice for securing access to your repositories. Unlike SSH keys, which grant broad access, PATs provide more granular control over what actions are allowed. You can create tokens with specific scopes (like read-only access, or access only to certain repositories), making them more secure and easier to manage. PATs are also easier to revoke if compromised, as you can delete individual tokens without affecting your entire account.

1. Go to GitHub Settings → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
2. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "DS2002 Course")
4. Select the **repo** scope (this enables clone, pull, push, and submitting pull requests)
5. Set the token expiration date to May 31, 2026.
6. Click **Generate token** at the bottom
7. **Copy the token immediately** - you won't be able to see it again!
8. Store it securely (you'll use it as your password when using git from your local machine)

### Step 4: GitHub Education

<a href="https://github.com/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign up for GitHub Education</a>. It is free and will augment your abilities to use GitHub and Codespaces. 

## Using GitHub Codespaces for Your Projects (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is to use GitHub Codespaces. You can launch Codespaces directly through your repo in GitHub; all the software tools you will need are already configured and will be at your disposal with a single click of a button. It couldn't be easier. 

1. In your forked repository, click the green **Code** button
2. Select the **Codespaces** tab
3. Click **Create codespace on main** (or select a branch)
4. GitHub will automatically detect and use the default devcontainer configuration
5. Wait for the codespace to initialize (this may take a few minutes)

You should see a screen like this:

Once your codespace is ready, you'll have a fully configured development environment in your browser!

## Using GitHub Codespaces for MySQL Practice and Labs (Recommended)

The course repository defines a Codespace setup with MySQL Server, MySQL Client and PHPAdmin. Follow the [MySQL Setup in GitHub Codespace](codespace-mysql.md) instructions to set this up in your fork of the course repository. 

## Access to UVA's High Performance Computing Cluster

Throughout this course students will have access to [UVA's HPC systems (Afton & Rivanna)](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/hpc/). In addition to HPC specific activities in Module 3, you may also use the system as an alternative to Codespaces for other course activities.

**You don't have to install software on your own computer to access the systems.**

The login process is described in the **[HPC Access](hpc.md)** instructions.

## Optional: Installation on your own computer

If you prefer to set up the development environment on your own computer instead of using GitHub Codespaces, follow the platform-specific instructions:

- **[Windows Setup](windows.md)** - Instructions for setting up on Windows
- **[MacOS & Linux Setup](mac-linux.md)** - Instructions for setting up on macOS and Linux

**Note:** If you are new to programming and are not familiar with installing programming tools on your computer, we highly recommend using [GitHub Codespaces](#using-github-codespaces-for-your-projects-recommended) instead. This will allow you to get started immediately without the hassle of troubleshooting any setup issues.
