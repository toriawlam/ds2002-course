# Hands-On Exercises

The exercises are structured into three activity levels:

1. **In-class activities**
   These are exercises you should complete first during our synchronous class sessions.

2. **Reference & Additional Practice**
   These sections provide more detailed command references and code snippets. Work through them if you finish the in-class activities early, and outside of class to consolidate your learning. Completing these practice exercises will prepare you for the labs, quizzes, and final project.

3. **Advanced Topics (Optional)**
   In this section you can explore specific topics in more depth. Working through this content is optional and is not required to complete labs, quizzes, or the final project.
